# Java Stock Prices Client

This project contains two modules:

 - A Java client that connects via REST & RSocket to a Kotlin service which streams a randomly generated set of prices. 
 - A JavaFX user interface that displays the updating prices in real time on a line chart.
 
This project is based on the demo at [SpringOne Platform 2019](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2019/10/fully-reactive-spring-kotlin-and-javafx-playing-together/). This specific code is an [IntelliJ IDEA tutorial](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/tag/tutorial-reactive-spring/) showing how to build Reactive applications with Kotlin, Spring, Java and JavaFX.
